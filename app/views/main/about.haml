%h2.underlined.bold About us
%p Animal Apps was founded in the summer of 2008 by #{link_to "Robert Matei", "http://www.linkedin.com/in/robertmatei"} and #{link_to "David Pekar", "http://www.linkedin.com/in/davepekar"} in San Francisco, CA.  Since then, we've been hard at work creating successful applications on the social network platforms. Now, a core team of 4 recent Stanford grads, we are profitable and growing fast. We build our products with Ruby on Rails.
